        <h2>Scams</h2>
        
        <h3>Advance fee fraud</h3>
        <p  style="text-align: left;">A scammer request fees upfront or personal information in return for goods, services, money or rewards that they never supply. </p>
        <p  style="text-align: left;">Scammers invent convincing and seemingly genuine reasons for requesting payment, such as to cover fees or taxes. </p>            
        <p  style="text-align: left;">They often ask for payment by international wire transfer. </p>   
        <p  style="text-align: left;">These scams are commonly mass-marketed with scammers sending them out to thousands of people all over the world at the same time, usually by email. </p>
        <p  style="text-align: left;">Therefore giving untrusted sources your email can be devastating. A common practice of keeping track of trusted and untrusted sources are several email addresses, a couple of official addresses for sites like amazon or google and using different addresses for all sites you’re unsure of the privacy standards.</p>

        <h3>Dating and romance scams</h3>
        <p>Scammers create fake profiles on legitimate dating websites.  </p>
        <p>They use these profiles to try to enter into a relationship with you so they can get a hold of your money and personal details. </p>
        <p>The scammer will develop a strong rapport with you then ask for money to help cover costs associated with illness, injury, travel or a family crisis. </p>        
        <p>Scammers seek to exploit your emotions by pulling on your heartstrings. Sometimes the scammers will take months and months to build up the rapport. </p>        
        <p>Never trust unknown online profiles. If the person doesn't want to meet up with you, it's already fishy, it could be the next catfish. In some cases, the scammer will pressure the individual to send private photos and may even send “own” pictures. Recognize these red flags before they’re able to blackmail you. </p>
        
        <h3>Computer hacking</h3>        
        <p>Phishing emails are commonly used by scammers to trick you into giving them access to your computer.  </p>        
        <p>They ‘fish’ for your details by encouraging you to click on a link or attachment.  </p>        
        <p>If you click, malicious software will be installed and the hacker will have access to files and information stored on your computer. </p>        
        <p>A phishing email often appears to come from an organisation that you know and trust, like a bank or financial institution, asking you to enter your account password on a fake copy of the site’s login page.</p>        
        <p>Or the scammer calls you and tries to convince you that he wants to check for viruses on your PC, to then install a fake virus and the phishing software themselves, which will then magically wipe out the virus.</p>        
        <p>If you provide your account details, the scammer can hack into your account and take control of your profile.</p>
        
        <h3>Online shopping, classified and auction scams </h3>        
        <p>Scammers like shopping online for victims. Not getting what you paid for is a common scam targeting online shoppers.</p>        
        <p>A scammer will sell a product and send a faulty or inferior quality item, or nothing at all. They may also pretend to sell a product just to gather your credit card or bank account details.</p>        
        <p>These scams can also be found on reputable online classified pages.</p>        
        <p>An online auction scam involves a scammer claiming that you have a second chance to buy an item that you placed a bid on because the winner has pulled out.</p>        
        <p>The scammer will ask you to pay outside of the auction site’s secure payment facility.</p>        
        <p>If you do, your money will be lost and the auction site will not be able to help you.</p>        
        <p>The easiest way to avoid those scams is to shop only on trusted websites.</p>
        
        <h3>Banking, credit card and online account scams</h3>        
        <p>Scammers send emails or text messages that appear to be from your bank, a financial institution or an online payment service.  </p>        
        <p>They usually claim that there is a problem with your account and request that you verify your details on a fake but convincing copy of the bank’s website. </p>        
        <p>Card skimming is the copying of information from the magnetic stripe of a credit card or automatic teller machine (ATM) card.  </p>        
        <p>Scammers skim your card by putting a discreet attachment on an ATM or EFTPOS machine. They may even install a camera to capture your pin.  </p>        
        <p>Once your card is skimmed, scammers can create copies and make changes to your account. </p>        
        <p>To avoid this type of scam check navigate to the official website of your bank or payment service and log in. If the email isn't a fraud, the website will still ask you for verification or similar.  </p>
        
        <h3>Golden opportunity and gambling scams</h3>
        <p>Scams often begin with an unexpected phone call or email from a scammer offering a not-to-be-missed high return or guaranteed investment in shares, real estate, options or foreign currency trading.  </p>        
        <p>While it may seem convincing, in reality, the scammer will take your money and you will never receive the promised returns.  </p>        
        <p>Another scam promises to accurately predict the results of horse races, sports events, stock market movements or lotteries.  </p>        
        <p>Scammers promise you huge returns based on past results and trends. To participate, you may be asked to pay for membership fees, special calculators, newsletter subscriptions or computer software programs. </p>        
        <p>Quite similar are pyramid schemes. This scheme will typically allow you to sell stuff or similar. You would need to buy a membership or a starter kit to start and get promised to have a high outcome without really working. The main focus however is to get you to convince two or more other people to also invest in this scam. The tricky part about this scam is, that if you manage to get these people to invest in the scam you (normally) get paid, but if you don't get enough people convinced it seems like you’re to be blamed and rightfully lose money. </p>
        <p>Avoiding those scams can be tricky, however, the general rule of thumb is that others won't allow you to make easy money without working or taking a huge risk. Otherwise, they’d do it themselves. </p>

        <h2>Hacks</h2>
        
        <h3>Fake WAP </h3>
        <p>In a fake WAP (Wireless Access Point) attack, the hacker sets up a wireless router with a convincingly legitimate name in a public spot where people might connect to it. Once they do, the hacker can monitor and even change internet connections to steal sensitive data or force the user to download malware onto their device. </p>
        <p>How many times have you been to a hotel, cafe, or airport that had one or more separate guest wifi networks? How sure were you that you connected to a secured router owned by the establishment you were visiting? </p>
        <p>A VPN or other data encryption services are a good defence for these types of hacks. </p>

        <h3>Credential reuse </h3>
        <p>This is an attack that can follow after a data breach at a server hosting many users’ login information. It works under the assumption that many people use the same password across multiple sites, which is unfortunately true.  </p>
        <p>After using a vulnerability to access login info, the hacker can try using the same info on a more sensitive website to gain access to more dangerous and damaging information. </p>
        <p>Sadly data breaches can always happen and are not in the control of the user, however having several different and secure passwords will help. </p>
            
        <h3>Macro malware in documents </h3>
        <p>Document-based macro malware is a very insidious type of malware that is easy to detect and avoid if you know what you’re looking for. Many document file types, like .doc or .pdf, can run scripts when they’re opened. However, these functions usually have to be permitted by the user to run through a prompt when the document is opened. </p>
        <p>If you give the document permission to run the macro, you will be at the hacker’s mercy. These scripts can open numerous vulnerabilities in your system, allowing hackers to upload more serious malware and take control of your computer. </p>
        <p>Most antivirus software will detect those hacks, however, if a document asks for your permission to execute something you should know and trust the author or at least ask the source why there is code implemented. </p>
            
        <h3>IoT attacks </h3>
        <p>IoT (Internet of Things) devices are exciting because of the potential new features they introduce into our daily lives. However, they are also frighteningly vulnerable to cyber attacks. These devices have limited computing power and storage, leaving little room for robust security features. </p>
        <p>The passwords are often left as the factory defaults, meaning almost anyone can log into them. Even worse, they provide a direct bridge between the digital and physical worlds. Therefore change it immediately to a secure and single-used password.  </p>
        <p>A hacker from across the street or the ocean can hack into your air conditioner, oven, refrigerator, or home alarm system. However, your infected devices can also be used as parts of expansive botnets – virtual armies of connected devices that hackers can use to launch orchestrated attacks on targeted servers. </p>
        <p>This type of attack is called DDOS attack and generates hundreds of thousands of requests to servers to shut it down. The hacker needs lots of PCs infected with the malware to start a big attack. The malware itself however is almost not noticeable for the user, as it's using just a fraction of the bandwidth. It’s therefore not harmful to the user, but your PC is still part of a collective attack. </p>
            
        <h3>DNS spoofing </h3>
        <p>DNS servers are like the signposts of the Internet. Without them, you couldn’t type in address names in your browser and had to type in the IP. When you enter a website into your browser, they tell your device where to go to get the information you need. </p>
        <p>If a hacker can in some way poison the information provided by a DNS server, however, they can potentially take thousands of users to a malicious domain as part of an attack. </p>
        <p>DNS spoofing can happen in many different ways – by corrupting the data on its way to your device, by feeding corrupted information to a DNS server, or by completely taking it over. They all have a similar result, however – they send you to a website that the hacker has designed to take advantage of you.</p>
